The approach this person used is by providing random mutations to the agent so it would evolve that logic to play the snake game. </td>
        <td> Took time to read into other resources that classmates posted to shared document. Learned about a couple ways to incorporate a strategies that have already been made for the snake game into the hungry geese game. Many involved neural networks and having the agent learn from simulated experiences to gain reward. I think after reading these articles, I want to further my knowledge with Neural Networks and I see we have some sources in our common doc. </td>

I see that they function like humn brains that have neurons and fluctuate their adaptability given different environments. I tried playing with finding a smaller test lost. My next step is to watch about Neural Networks and Deep Learning in coursera.  </td>
        <td> Began to watch <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning"> Coursera </a> videos about Neural Networks and Deep Learning. I watched the first week worth of videos which introduces what the course will cover. At this point I have learned what Neural Networks are and supervised learning in them. They also touch bases on why deep learning is popular right now and its applications. </td>
        <td> Watched about half of the content for Week 2 Neural Networks and Deep Learning Coursera course. Some of the topics covered were Binary Classification, Logistic Regression, Gradient Descent, Derivatives, and Vectorization. After watching these videos I was confused and I think my next steps for next week will be to take a step back and do more application practice of basic manipulation with sets of data. I plan on going to office hours to make a plan of how to come up with my own assignments. </td>

        <td> I looked up a follow along course on youtube to begin to pratice Python. I had previously in week 4, began to do a couple tutorials to become familiar with the Jupyter Notebooks environment. The course video can be found <a href="https://bit.ly/3sWqcgI"> here. </a> During this session I got familiarity with problem solving in Python, which has a similar format to Python. I also learned about a couple IDEs other than Jupyter Notebooks for Python. </td>
        <td> During this session I continued the course video I follow along last session. So far it is more basic review on simple declaring variables, using operations, calling %whos to get all variables that are in the workspace and getting their variable type. Pretty simple concepts that are easy to grasp because I now have experience in another language. I plan on looking for a higher level video to follow along per se more applied on data science application. </td>
        <td> Watched a very interesting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y"> documentary</a> about the game GO. This game is very popular in South Korea where they train people from a young age. The professor from the Reinforcement Learning course videos that I watched was one of the main managers in a team. This team using neural networks to develop an artificial player that would optimally find a pattern to beat any human player. The team developed their agent and had it compete against a local best player of GO in a part of Europe. Their agent is called AlphaGo. AlphaGo was able to beat this human player. Then Alpha go went up again a man who is among the top 7 world players of the game Go. With a result of 4-1, AlphGo wins. It was interesting how so many people were broadcasting these plays. Another point in their development of AlphaGo, after going against their local opponent, they had the man play several rounds with AlphaGo to find a weakness before it went against one of the worlds best players. </td>

        <td> Picked up again on watching <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning"> Coursera </a> videos about Neural Networks and Deep Learning. I stoped at about a quarter of week 3 material. Some topics that were covered were more examples of vectorization, broadcasting Python and Jupyter Notebooks (which was more of a recap), representing Neural Networks and what computing their outputs looks like.   </td>
        <td> Continued the Neural Networks and Deep Learning Coursera, wrapped up week 3 topics. Some of the topics that were highlighted were more Vectorization examples, activation function which calculate and determine the output of neural networks, derivatives of activation functions. </td>
        <td> I followed along with a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rutailiu/titanic-ml-project">journal</a> from a team for the Titanic Kaggle Competition. I needed some example of importing data and manipulating it, analyzing it, and manipulating it. </td>

        <td> My intent during this seating was to set an environement of Pyhton and Juptyer Notebook in VSCode, but after a while I decided that I would just use the environments I have. I could not get a Python terminal, like Ricky had mentioned that we should have, instead I had a powershell console. I also browsed through the DS256 course page and material. I set a space on my laptop to install the DS Jupyter Notebooks. I plan on doing some of those assignments in the future to begin to learn the applied coding aspect in DS to prepare for the Exam. </td>
        <td> After looking at some of the coding implementation for more DS focused, I reevaluated my confidence with Python. In a previous week I followed along with a begineers Youtube video to Python and because I began with variable declarations, assignment, and basic operators, it seemed easy to me. However, during this session I went back to Python learning. This time around I followed the <i>Whirlwind Tour of Python</i> by Jake VanderPlas. I started with Basic Python Semantics: Operators. Although I had reviewed operators before, I went to the end of the section to look at <i>Identity and Membership Operators</i> because I have never heard of that before. I ended at <i>Built-In Types: Simple Values</i> which was about variable types. Something I found interesting is how Python has the type "NoneType" that indicates null, meanwhile, I belive in Java you just store null in any data type straight forward. </td>

        <td> During this session I continued <i>Whirlwind Tour of Python</i> by Jake VanderPlas. I started with the <i>Built-In Data Structures.</i> I don't know how much I will need apply data structures in the coding for the DS competitions. However, it was nice to review some concepts since I took the course last year. The data structures covered were list, tuple, dict(hashmaps), and set. This included declaring, using pertaining methods, and accessing values. I ended on <i>Control Flow</i> which covered condition statements and loops. I decided to review this seccion because although I know how loops and condition statements work, I wanted to understand the syntax of these funtions. </td>
        <td> This session was a continuation of <i>Whirlwind Tour of Python</i> by Jake VanderPlas. This time I reviewed <i>Defining and Using Functions.</i> Again this was a quick review to look for syntax in Pyhton just like I did for conditional statements and for loops in my last session. This section also covered Flexible Arguements and Anonymous Functions, which was new to me. Then I ended in <i>Errors and Excpetions.</i> This was a review of different types of errors and writing code to catch those exceptions. Also the command raise was covered, which reminds me of when we use print statements to debug in Java.</td>

      <tr>
        <td> Continued <i>Whirlwind Tour of Python</i> by Jake VanderPlas in during this session. I began with <i>Iterators</i>. This section simply covered implementing a range and a for-each in loops. Enumurate to keep track of the index. Zip which syncs two iterables when you want to iterate multple lists at the same time. Map which combines an iterator and function over a list. Filter is the same as Map, but it only shows values that are true for the function. </td>
        <td> During this section I started with <i>List Comprehension</i> in <i>Whirlwind Tour of Python</i> by Jake VanderPlas. This section is rewriting loops in a format that would match the English more. I ended at <i>Generators</i>, which is still confusing to me. I understood that it is similar to List Comprehension. The book described it as a recipe for producing values, however, I still do not understand the difference between these two concepts. </td>
        <td> I continued <i>Whirlwind Tour of Python</i> by Jake VanderPlas, starting with <i>Modules and Packages.</i> This had to do with importing modules and this also includes third-party modules. This makes sense how we can import modules from lets say Kaggle and make working with data science. I also went over <i>String Manipulation and Regular Expressions.</i> This section was very lengthy and was nice to go over string specific methods in Python, so it was straightforward. Next week I hope to begin chapter 5 from <i>Python Data Science Handbook</i> by Jake VanderPlas. I want to focus on chapter 5 because it is about machine learning and basic In-Depth algorithms that I could potentially use for the exam. </td>
